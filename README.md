# React Budget Tracker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This application was developed with the use of a tutorial from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

The Budget Tracker Application accepts user input for recording expenses of a given month, date and year. The inputted expense is then displayed on the UI with the corresponding dollar amount and date.

## Description

The Budget Tracker Application is a ReactJS application that has different components for different functionality of the UI and JavaScript functionality. The application uses state and props to pass components, such as the component for the user-entered date to be displayed when applying a filter for the year, within other components. The application accepts the users input and adds the expense to the UI and filters the expense based on the year. Once the user specifies a year through the filter, it will display only those expenses. Also, once the filter is applied, a bar graph is updated to visually display the amount of money spent for the specific month. Once a new expense is added to the UI, the expense form is closed so that it is not displayed on the UI, alloying the list of expenses to be displayed.
